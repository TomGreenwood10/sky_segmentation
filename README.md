# sky_segmentation

## Sumary
Cambridge Spark applied data science bootcamp capstone project writeup.

## Background
For my capstone broject I worked with a dataset of sky images from the British Antartic Survery (BAS). The objectives were to determine overall cloud cover in the images and cloud cover at the zenith.  I wrote an image segmentation program to perform this analysis.  This repo contains the project report.

An NDA was signed with BAS that does not permit me to relese code from this project as the IP is owned by them, however it does permit me to share the IP in written publications on a non comercial basis (excluding code), hence this report.
